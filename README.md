🚚 SmartRoute Optimizer

Welcome to SmartRoute Optimizer—your go-to AI/ML-powered solution for smarter, faster, and more efficient delivery route planning. Crafted with passion at the MINeD 2025 Hackathon, this project is all about transforming complex logistics into seamless operations, saving both time and resources.

🌟 Why SmartRoute Optimizer?

In a world where speed and convenience are everything, traditional delivery planning just can't keep up. Manual methods are slow, error-prone, and inefficient. That’s where SmartRoute Optimizer steps in. By harnessing the power of AI and ML, we’re redefining how businesses handle deliveries—making them faster, smarter, and more reliable.

🚀 What Makes It Awesome?

AI/ML-Powered Trip Optimization: Forget guesswork—our smart algorithms create efficient delivery schedules effortlessly.

Automated Vehicle Assignment: Prioritizes eco-friendly rides (3W & 4W-EV) to reduce carbon footprint before rolling out the regular 4W fleet.

Time-Slot Savvy Deliveries: Guarantees your packages arrive right when customers expect them.

Interactive Route Maps: See your delivery routes come to life with beautiful, dynamic maps powered by Folium.

📊 What Data Do We Use?

Shipments Data: Contains everything about delivery points and time slots.

Vehicle Information: Details about vehicle capacities, types, and coverage range.

Store Location: The starting and ending point for every trip—our delivery HQ.

⚙️ Built With Love (and Tech)

Python: The brain behind the operation.

Pandas & NumPy: For crunching numbers and wrangling data like pros.

Geopy: Calculates real-world distances with geospatial data magic.

Folium: Turns boring coordinates into stunning interactive maps.

📈 What Do You Get?

Our optimizer churns out detailed delivery plans that include:

Trip ID for easy tracking

Shipment Sequence & Time Slots for clear delivery timelines

Assigned Vehicle Type to match capacity and range

Key Metrics: MST Distance, Trip Time, Capacity Utilization, Time Utilization, and Coverage Utilization
